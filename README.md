# FlightDelayPrediction
Flight delay prediction
After the covid-19 pandemic, international flight tickets were very limited, and most 
airlines cut off their flights. On the other hand, due to various border inspection requirements and 
different countries' centers for disease control and prevention, lots of countries need covid PCR 
test taken in a certain time frame. Because of these two reasons, many international students 
have to purchase a non-direct flight and transfer to the US to make sure they catch all the 
international flights and get to the border on time.

In this project, domestic flight information is used to implement machine 
learning model for flight delay prediction. According to the federal aviation administration, 
“Flight delays of less than 15 minutes are not reported in Operations Network”，
15 mins after scheduled arrival time is used as the boundary to classify on-time and delay in this 
project.
